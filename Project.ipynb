    "You will need access to a PostgreSQL installation where you have superuser permissions. If you do not have such access elsewhere, installing to your personal workstation is a good idea.  Alternately, you might wish to use a Docker container for a self-contained installation.  See `https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres` for details on that option.  Unless you have a specific need to work with an existing installation, choosing a PostgreSQL version of 12 or higher is best.\n",

    "A number of columns were probably created as CHAR or VARCHAR field, but have only a small number of distinct values.  Those would be more efficiently and descriptively stored as enumerations.  Enumerations are discussed in somewhat more detail in the next lesson, but in brief, you can create one within a particular database using code similar to:\n",

For example, what is the UTC offset and daylight savings change schedule at a given timezone?  What is the contact information for a given airline, and what airports do they service?\n",

    "The this task you need to complete two parts.  First you should create tables `timezones` and `airlines`, and populate them with the values currently existing for the foreign key column.  In each case, simply add a second text column called `description` (although more specific fields would clearly be needed for a production use).\n",
